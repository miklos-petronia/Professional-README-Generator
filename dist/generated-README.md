  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
My project is a README generator. The project will assist end users in generating a README file without applying a mark down syntax. 

The problem is that most README projects tends to be overlooked. It might be due to that the developers are lazy and don’t want to incorpate a appropriate syntax when creating a README file. Additionally, developers do not know what to include in the README file. 

The README generator would give users the a few questions to answer and develop a professional comprehensive README constructed on their responses. It will provide the developer with the ability to create their project in a professional way, and increase the probability that a other user would want to use their app comparing to other apps that does not use a readme file.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
Click the repository link under. Select and copy the directory of your choice. Open the file in the visual studio code. Open the terminal and work under professional readme generator. You will be ready to start the application.  

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
 After the installation is done, run this code: node index.js in the terminal. Answers the question and after it is complete, you will see a console log illustrating your answers to your questions, a message will say ‘File is created’. You would see your file in dist folder called ‘generatedREADME’. It is generated in a mark-down syntax to copy and paste the code into the project.
